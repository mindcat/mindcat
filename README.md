I'm an electrical & computer engineering PhD student researching quantum compilation, error correction, & routing, who is especially interested in the future of qubits (neutral atom, topological, & cat) and quantum devices (QPICs, superconducting, and robust, possibly multi-platform, quantum architectures). 

My background (BSc in CS) is in software engineering and scientific computing, where I am most interested in language theory, systems programming, automata, & data structures. I love idiomatic and opinionated languages, like Rust, Gleam, Haskell, APL, Go, Julia, and more. I have extensive experience with Python, Java, C, C++, and TypeScript, as well as with machine learning- SciKit, PyTorch, NumPy, and TensorFlow. I prefer working with PyTorch. 

My more disparate academic interests include neuromorphic computing, hardware acceleration (particularly FPGA), abstract math (topology, graph theory for q. routing, sheaf theory for q. networking, matrix theory, markov chains), photonic ICs, semiconductor applications of 2D materials, ...

_My non-academic interests include:_

Philosophy (my undergrad minor), particularly Παρμενίδης -> Πλάτων -> Eπίκουρος, though I do not enjoy the aristotelians or the stoics. I also enjoy the works of Plutarch and Lucan. Contemporarily, I appreciate Kantian deontology, Hegel, Feuerbach, Stirner, Marx, and Engels, and their influences. Alexandra Kollontai and Rosa Luxembourg are my favorite writers on philosophy, political economy, and sociology. Lacan, Deleuze & Guattari, and moreso Baudrillard are post-structuralist guilty pleasures, while Fisher, Parenti, & Varoufakis are the best of the past few decades. Zizek is overrated. I am a _strong_ believer in a free & open source future, and libre software, hardware, and knowledge. 

Languages, linguistics, and orthography. I have studied (to varying success) attic greek, polish (indepedently, not in classes), chinese, arabic, and ASL (in increasing order of familiarity). I love orthographies, natural and constructed; 𐑖𐑱𐑝𐑾𐑯, 조선글, sitelen pona, Gregg stenography, Tengwar, ᐊᓂᐦᔑᓈᐯᒧᐎᓐ, Stokoe notation, and მხედრული. I am fascinated by the history of scripts, stenography, typesetting, pens, and typewriters. I regularly read and write in an English constructed orthography, Shavian, which I have built several tools for.

10/13/25 - the below is a solid few years out of date. I have 3 projects I really need to clean up enough to add to the list, leaving this as a reminder to myself...


##### Complete

*[Space Race Keyboard](https://github.com/mindcat/SpaceRaceSweep)*
> A custom modification of the [Ferris Sweep's](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) 34 key split keyboard. I altered the PCB to fit my hands and designed svg's to add a design by altering the solder mask and screen print. It uses Elite-C v4 USB-C microcontrollers, jade choc mini switches, and the layout I programmed is colemak-dh with support for stenography, a numpad & coding symbols layer, and extensive macros. 

##### In Progress

*[Vitri](https://github.com/mindcat/bigredhacks?tab=readme-ov-file#project-description)*
> Made for the Cornell hackathon, [BrickHack 9](https://devpost.com/software/best-ever-favorite-location-journal) with [@anhnlh](https://github.com/anhnlh). Gave us some solid experience in cross-platform mobile development, and we ended up liking the result (conceptually) so much we've continued building it out, with plans to release it for iOS and Android, if only so we can be the only ones to use it!

*[Stellarly](https://github.com/mindcat/brickhack9)*
> Made for the RIT hackathon, [BrickHack 9](https://brickhack9.devpost.com) with [@anhnlh](https://github.com/anhnlh). Plan to refactor math currently in the frontend js into the much faster, more clear syntax of the julia backend. *abandoned*

<!-- *[FizzBuzz](https://github.com/mindcat/fizzbuzz)*
> An exercise in demonstrating the syntax and functionality of several different languages. -->

##### Planned

<!-- *[Chess PCB](https://github.com/mindcat/pccb)*
> "Printed Chess Circuit Board" -- microcontroller powered chess algorithm (rust) on a custom chess board pcb. Practice with embedded Rust and the pecularities required with addressing IO and safely utilizing unsafe Rust at the firmware level. 

*[ELLI](https://github.com/mindcat/elli)*
> "Ensemble Learning Language Identification" -- A from-scratch machine learning implementation in Julia that can train models (decision trees of binary feature functions) on labeled excerpts from Wikipedia. Compares precise strong predictors (relying on function word identification) with AdaBoosted weak predictors designed for general language use. Should support Polish, French, Spanish, English, Dutch, German, Portuguese, Czech, and Danish.  <- this is really just an expansion of an AI binary tree project, porting it from Python to Julia and increasing the number of languages it can identify and discern between. 

*[Peculiar Allure](https://github.com/mindcat/)*
> "Visualizing Strange Attractors" -- An experiment in getting familiar with the matrix and visualization capabilities of Julia (and my own love of linear algebra) to model a number of diverse attractors with fractal characteristic (famously Lorenz <ρ = 28, σ = 10, β = 8/3>, Rössler <ρ = 1/5, σ = 1/5, β = 5.7>). Additionally, there's a number of normative attractors. 

*[Linear 241](https://github.com/mindcat/linear)*
> "Linear Algebra Textbook in LaTeX" -- A companion to the MATH-241 course at RIT based off of my in class notes to provide reference material for a class without slides and as notes for accessibility. 

*[Quantum 251](https://github.com/mindcat/linear)*
> "Principles and Applications of Quantum Technologies Textbook in LaTeX" -- A companion to the PHYS-251 course at RIT based off of my in class notes to provide reference material for a class without slides and as notes for accessibility. 

*[VFD](https://github.com/mindcat/vfd)*
> "Homemade Vacuum Fluorescent Display" -- microcontroller on a custom pcb running a from-scratch vacuum fluorescent display. 

<!-- *[Philosophy Club Website](https://github.com/mindcat/philclubsite)*
> "Official Philsophy Club Website" -- 

*[Flipper Zero IR Remote](https://github.com/mindcat/flippIR)*
> "" --

*[Calculator](https://github.com/mindcat/curta)*
> "Curta Calculator Swift App" -- iOS application that emulates a curta calculator.

*[](https://github.com/mindcat/)*
> "" -- -->


<!-- *[Brain](https://github.com/mindcat/brain)* -->
<!-- > An exercise in exampling the syntax and functionality of several different languages. -->

y_k =  \varphi \left( \sum_{j=0}^{m} w_{kj} x_j \right)
